"""Pre-push guard — main-history protection for the Dyad Runtime (dyad-rt).

The UNBYPASSABLE spine of the runtime (native-adaptation of cairn's dyad-rt, cycle-47):
git-layer, so it fires regardless of the harness permission mode — including under
`bin/claude`, where the native permission gate is OFF and the runtime is the authority.

`main` advances ONLY through a PR merged on the forge (server-side, per
memory self-merge-pr-to-main); a *local* push that updates `refs/heads/main`
— direct, force, or delete — is never legitimate here.

Reads the git pre-push payload on stdin (one line per ref being pushed):
    <local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>

REFUSES any line whose <remote ref> is refs/heads/main. Visible escape: `--no-verify`
(the Operator's deliberate override — wu-wei: the human is never forced). Pure stdlib.
